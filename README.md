# Seismic data processing

I would recommend installing this in a `conda` environment.

This can be installed by:

1. clone repo
2. `cd` to top-level directory (i.e. with setup.py in it)
3. run  `pip install .` (or `pip install -e .`)
4. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Hopefully then the notebooks in `notebooks/` should work. There may still be an issue with
certain matplotlib plotting libraries (one of which, if I recall, requires installing in a virtualenv or conda environment)
